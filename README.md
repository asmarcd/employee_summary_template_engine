  ## Description
  
This program allows you to interact with the console in order to build out a templated "About us" style webpage for your engineering team, without needing to build anything from scratch. The HTML that it generates can easily be inserted into an existing project to make for a quick and easy credits page for you and your team.

  
  ## Installation
  
You will need to install node.js and inquirer to run this program, and jest if you want to run the associated tests.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Simply open the folder in the console and run “node app.js” then answer the questions. An HTML file will be generated for you based on your answers in the Output folder. It will be called team.html.
